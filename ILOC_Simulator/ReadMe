Simulator can handle logical operations:
   and, or, xor
-----------------------------------------
The latencies for instructions are

load/store  5 cycles
mult/div    2 cycles
rest        1 cycle
-----------------------------------------

To call simulator on input file  "test.i", execute the 
following command on the Linux prompt:

> ./sim < test.i

The system reports the program output, and the number of
instructions and operations executed, the the number of
cycles.
-----------------------------------------

The subdirectory "src" contains the source code of the 
ILOC simulator.
